Simple SD Card Sync

I have no Idea what i am doing this is a WIP progect to try to teach my self programing.

Goals:
  Have it access the Switch sd card and at a minimum support syncing one dir to google drive to sync retroarch saves. 

  Impliment some sort of overlay or system app to have it run in background with syncs on a schedule.

If I can figure it out:
  
  Add other cloud services. (OneDrive DropBox etc.)
